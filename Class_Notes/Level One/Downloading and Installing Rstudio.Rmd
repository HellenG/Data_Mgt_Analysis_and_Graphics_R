I have selected RStudio 0.99.491 - Windows Vista/7/8/10. That's it, it will start downloading.

Check the status bar for the downloading progress.


\*It might take some time depending on internet speed, so hold on.

### Installing Rstudio

Click on the downloaded executable file, this should bring the setup welcome screen.

Next, choose the installation folder. The default is usually recommended, but you can choose another folder.

To avoid rebooting your computer, close any other application that is running. Now indicate if you want a start menu containing the programs shortcuts.
