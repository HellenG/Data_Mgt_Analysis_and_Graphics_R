About Level One
---------------

First welcome to Data Analysis using `R`. This level (one) aims to introduce both `R` which is the core or base program and `RStudio`, one of R's Integrated Development Environment (IDE): An IDE is basically a program that makes programming easier.

We will begin by downloading and understanding both R and RStudio including how to work interactively using the `console` and writing `scripts` (similar to syntax in SPSS and "do-files" in STATA). We shall further discuss how to install and work with add-on programs called `packages`.

With the basics of how to start, work and close R and RStudio done, we shall venture into the most important knowledge or skill you need to have in order to do any data analysis in R, this is `making function calls` or simply issuing commands.

Later we shall get to know how to manage different versions of your documents like scripts using a `version control system` called `git` and how to freely store/share the documents online using `GitHub`. This shall become quite handy when you make changes on your document or collaborate with others.

Next we shall explore R's data types and objects and how to transform and manipulate them. We shall also see how to import and export data from or into various other programs.

Since time series analysis is a critical data analysis technique, understanding how R works with dates and time is crucial and a session on this shall also be covered.

As we wind-up this level, we shall have a glimpse of R's wonderful world of graphics, something this program is revered on. We shall also discuss how and where to get help. Finally we shall conclude with case studies covering most of the areas discussed as a way to cement knowledge and skills covered.

It's my hoped that by close of this level you will have the ability to work with R and be ready for data analysis session.
