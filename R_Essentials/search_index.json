["index.html", "R Essentials Preface", " R Essentials Hellen Gakuruh 2017-02-03 Preface First welcome to this book on R Essentials. This book aims to introduce both R - the core/base program and RStudio - a program that makes programming easier; basically an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). We will begin by downloading and understanding both R and RStudio including how to work interactively using the console and writing scripts (similar to syntax in SPSS and “do-files” in STATA). We shall further discuss how to install and work with add-on/contributed programs called packages. With the basics of how to start, work and close R and RStudio done, we shall venture into the most important knowledge or skill we need to have in order to do any data analysis in R, this is making function calls or simply issuing commands. Later we shall get to know how to manage different versions of our documents like scripts using a version control system called Git and how to freely store/share the documents online using GitHub. This shall become quite handy when we make changes on our document or collaborate with others. Next we shall explore R’s data types and objects and how to transform and manipulate them. We shall also see how to import and export data from or into various other programs. Since time series analysis is a critical data analysis technique, understanding how R works with dates and time is crucial and a chapter on this is included. As we wind-up this book, we shall have a glimpse of R’s wonderful world of graphics, something this program is revered on. We shall also discuss how and where to get help. Finally we shall conclude with case studies covering most of the areas discussed as a way to cement knowledge and skills covered. It’s my hope that by close of this series you will have the ability to work with R and be ready for data analysis.
