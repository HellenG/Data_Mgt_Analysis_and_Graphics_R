### Blog15: March 31^st^, 2017

<h4 style="font-weight:bold">Slides are officially out and made first YouTube upload</h4>

Good week it was, managed to complete all slides, currently I am doing final edit and pushing to GitHub. Links to html versions are listed in [tutorials page](Pages/tutorials.html), I also intend to convert these slides to PDF and share on "Slideshare".

Great achievement, did my first YouTube video, not much really, but it means I can actually do more and hopefully improve on quality.

With Slides over, it's time to go back to finalizing "Essentials of Data Analysis and Graphics using R" book, specifically start working on chapter three "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)". Can't give exact time for release but anticipate it to be in two weeks from start. I should have a good idea by Friday.

Till next Friday, have a fantastic week.

### Blog14: March 24^th^, 2017

<h4 style="font-weight:bold">Going the extra mile</h4>

So I am way behind schedule, but it's all good as a lot of what I am doing will shorten time spent writing chapter on inferential statistics. I am going the extra mile to ensure all the essentials are covered and covered well (I was a bit rusty). 

Looking forward to creating colourful graphs during EDA chapter, so I will try to wind this up.

Sadly I did not get to teach this week but will strive to get at least one in-person training this quarter. Otherwise, I am thinking of YouTube sessions and some webinar's, they are actually way overdue.

Till next week (hopefully slides will be out), it's good weekend and good week from me. 

### Blog13: March 17^th^, 2017

<h4 style="font-weight:bold">Almost done and might be teaching next week</h4>

Doing final write-up on slides to "Introduction to Data Analysis and Graphics using R". It's been enjoyable refreshing on these essential concepts and look forward to start EDA.

I might be teaching next week, something I truly enjoy, so EDA might delay slightly, but it's all good, I will definitely get around to it.

Till next week, but do look out for my slides, I have tried to make them comprehensive, at least to presentation level. If you do attend one of my classes, let's have some fun learning.  
  

### Blog12: March 10^th^, 2017

<h4 style="font-weight:bold">Making presentations and looks like a summarized R-Essentials is in progress</h4>

A great week it was. I have managed to do three slides out of six and currently winding up on the fourth. I anticipate to have them out by end of next week.

As I write these slides, it's occurred to me I am actually writing a summarized version of "R-Essentials". This is great as I had hoped to write summarized/reference book once I am done with the three books. Guess I am up to speed on that one.

Well, till next week when I share the slides and prepare for EDA chapter.

###  Blog11: March 4^th^, 2017

<h4 style="font-weight:bold">Yap it's Out, next, presentations</h4>

Truly pleased to say Descriptive statistics is finally done (except for exercises) and it's out. Had a great time refreshing on these topics and looking forward to chapter 3. 

I will take sometime to prepare some slides for upcoming workshop so I anticipate chapter three to come out slightly later this month, but let's see next week what I will be up to and how much needs to be done. 

### Blog10: February 24^th^, 2017

<h4 style="font-weight:bold">Making progress and anticipate some change to index page</h4>

Progressing well with Chapter two and anticipated time to get it out is still feasible. Bulk of the concept is done with just a bit of formulas definition left. I will soon start on our case study as a wrap-up for this chapter.

Currently there is no changes made on index page, but I am optimistic some change will take place pretty soon. 

### Blog9: February 17^th^, 2017

<h4 style="font-weight:bold">Slight change on index page, upcoming blogdown package and making progress with chapter two</h4>

I have just made some slight changes on our index page, it's still a work-in-progress, but hopefully I will get a bright idea of how to redesign it using code. It is important for me that this page remains a pure HTML/CSS file as it demonstrates my skills in these two languages. 

A week or so ago I learnt of a new package called "blogdown", it's still under (advance) development but I am certainly anxious to try it. However, I am holding it off at least until I wind-up with this current write-up but I certainly look forward to learn it. I think, just like "bookdown", I will add a section of it in our second book "R - Beyond Essentials" as one way for analysts and R programmers to document.

This week I have concentrated on writing chapter two, "Descriptive statistics" and realized how much there is to basic statistics. I am writing this chapter knowing it is a crucial foundation on which all other statistics are based on. I have managed to write quantiles and measures of central tendency, am currently working on measures of dispersion and then move on to skewness and kurtosis and finally run through a case study. Holding all things equal (ceteris paribas), I estimate another two weeks for this chapter to come out.

P.S. I was thinking about the title of our third book, would "Essentials of Data Analysis and Graphics using R" sound okay or would it be too much essentials? It could be an essentials series, anyway, it's just a thought and I will make my final decision once I am done writing the whole book.

### Blog8: February 10^th^, 2017

<h4 style="font-weight:bold">Released Chapter One, Changed book's name and still working on Descriptive statistics</h4>

Introductory chapter of our third book is out, you can read it at this [page](../Data_Analysis/index.html). In this chapter I discuss a few terms as well as book structure. There some substantial changes in writing approach and topics to be covered; for one, in all the chapters (except chapter one), we shall begin with concept then demonstrated it's application using R. We shall also have a section on applicable graphs including a plotting session in R. At the end of each chapter, we will go through a brief case study covering concepts learnt in that chapter. This case study will conclude with a sample (partial) report showing how to report findings. Reason for taking this approach is because this is what I would have loved reading when I started data analysis.     

While writing Chapter one, I realized there quite a number of sections that go beyond an introductory session, in actual fact, my new approach for writing this book does not fall under introduction. For this reason I have changed the title of our third book to "Fundamentals of Data Analysis and Graphics using R". Hopefully during the weekend I will get around to changing the book cover.

As a result of this (out of the blues) change, I am a tad behind schedule with Descriptive statistics. But it's all good because this new approach makes me work extra hard to deliver a good read for anyone interested in data analysis. 

By the way, [Indepth Research Institute](http://www.indepthresearch.org/) is going to host a training Course on Data Management, Analysis and Graphics with R on: 20-03-17 and 10-04-17. Please visit [this](http://www.indepthresearch.org/research/project-management-monitoring-and-development-evaluation/2956-training-course-on-data-management-analysis-and-graphics-with-r) site for more details and consider attending the training, I will be facilitating.

One final word, I have just created an [issues page](https://github.com/HellenG/Data_Mgt_Analysis_and_Graphics_R/issues/1) for any improvement on "R Essentials" book. I would truly appreciate any enhancement for our book.

Till next Friday 

### Blog7: February 3rd, 2017

<h4 style="font-weight:bold">Book Release, Web Changes and Delay in Starting Descriptive Statistics Session</h4>

I am pleased to say I have managed to turn all tutorials for level one into an E-book titled ["R Essentials"](../R_Essentials/index.html) thanks to a new R package called [bookdown](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/introducing-bookdown/). This transition from session notes to a book will make it easy to read and follow through each concept. Level two and three notes will also become books with level two titled "R - Beyond Essentials" and level three "Introduction to Data Analysis and Graphics using R". I intend to release each chapter of as soon as I am through with them, so look out for updates.

Our E-book is hosted by [GitHub pages](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/) and I have been spending quite a bit of time trying to build the website. All pages are written with [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) except index/first page which I decided to code. My reason for doing this is to refresh on my HTML and CSS skills; it is not perfect and I certainly don't like the background so much but it's a start and I do hope to improve it with time. Take a [look](http://helleng.github.io/Data_Mgt_Analysis_and_Graphics_R/) and let me know.   

With my little detour to create an e-book and improve our tutorial website, scheduled start of "Descriptive Statistics" has been pushed forward (a bit). I do however intend to have it ready in the next two weeks (if not earlier), so not to worry, it's all good and I am hard at work.

One final word, I do intend to make it a habit to make a blog post every Friday just to keep you updated on progress I am making as regards tutorial notes (book chapters). This way there is an account of what is happening and if I make any necessary detour, then we will all be on the same page.

### Blog6: January 20, 2017

<h4 style="font-weight:bold">Alternating development and release of Level Two and Three</h4>

With Level One complete, we have the skills to carryout data analysis in R. Level two is meant get a bit deeper in R by learning how to develop functions and packaging them ready for GitHub/CRAN. However, it is not necessary to have these skills before doing data analysis. 

Therefore we will begin with data analysis sessions in Level Three but stop every after one session to introduce some concept in level two. That way we have both level two and level three tutorials moving in tandem.

Our next session is "Introduction to Descriptive Statistics" (session sixteen). Look out for it.

### Blog5: January 18, 2017

<h4 style="font-weight:bold">Draft version of Level One is now complete</h4>

Truly please to say Level One is now complete, it's been quite a journey to get here, but it is done and you can read it all from [notes and presentations page](tutorials.html). These notes can also be downloaded from my [LinkedIn page](https://ke.linkedin.com/in/hellengakuruh).

Good Reading


### Blog4: July 13, 2016

<h4 style="font-weight:bold;">Session Eight: Plotting in Base R</h4>

"There is so much to basic base R".

Base R offers so much it only requires knowledge of what is there and how you can fine tune it; more so as regards plotting.

As you embark on this session, I want you to think of three scenarios, first an analyst who has presented a very good report with graphs; second, an analyst who presents a good report along side a very long script, third an analyst who presents a well written report with communicative graphs, a well thought out, adequately commented and reproducible script along with data used. Given your introduction to R knowledge, whose work would you prefer and why?  


### Blog3: Thursday, May 26, 2016

<h4 style="font-weight:bold;">Technical Glitch</h4>

Well, I experienced what they call "a technical glitch" while trying to build my site (https://github.com/HellenG/HellenG.github.io). For some reason I am not getting the pages to work: I wonder where my "html" knowledge went to.

Anyway, I intend to address this very soon, but for now, the notes (for session one, two and four) can be forked from the tutorial's repo "https://github.com/HellenG/Data_Mgt_Analysis_and_Graphics_R"

Good reading



### Blog2: Saturday, May 21, 2016

<h4 style="font-weight:bold;">Session One of Level One Released</h4>

The long wait is finally over; first session of the "Data Analysis using R" is now ready and uploaded. Please check my [tutorial site](https://HellenG.github.io/Data_Mgt_Analysis_and_Graphics_R) and have a read.

Still working on the demo's and other links, but they will up and running in no time.

Enjoy


### Blog1: Friday, January 22, 2016

<h4 id="Title" style="font-weight:bold;"> My upcoming tutorial series on "Introduction to Data Analysis Using R"</h4>

I am about to start a data analysis tutorial using R. This will be a series of gradual learning centered at introducing data analysis and R. If you have thought of learning some analysis or R, come along and learn with me. 

<h4> Who is the training for?</h4>

This training is aimed at anyone interested in transforming readily available data into insightful information as well as those interested in reproducible analysis.

It is most suitable for those new to data analysis and R. 

<h4> What will you need?</h4>

All you need for this tutorial series is a working computer with about 150mb of disk space for the installation of R. You will of course need internet to download the slides.

But above all, you will need a great amount of interest and an open mind.

<h4> What will you learn?</h4>

The main goal of this tutorial is to enable you to use R for data analysis. The tutorial is divided into three levels. The first level will give you the foundation, while the second level delves right into R's core which is programming and level three will impart the core knowledge and skills of this tutorial series which is data analysis. Level two is optional but highly recommended for effective and efficient coding in R. 

Each level is divided into a series of sessions aimed at giving you a gradual learning structure. Below is the general outline: 

<u> Level 1: Main goal is to introduce R and R's graphics</u>

Here is what we will learn:

* SessionOne: Get to know R and RStudio
* SessionTwo: Make function calls
* SessionThree: Acquaint yourself with version control systems 
* SessionFour: Know data types and objects used in R
* SessionFive: Learn how to import and export data
* SessionSix: Be able to Transform/Manipulate different data objects including Subsetting them 
* SessionSeven: Know how to working with R's date and time
* SessionEight: Have a feel of base R's graphing capabilities
* SessionNine: Know where and how to get help
* SessionTen: Apply lessons learnt through Case Studies

<u>Level 2: Main goal is to learn how to Programming in R</u>

This is what we will be learn:

* SessionEleven: Looping System in R
* SessionTwelve: Environments
* SessionThirteen: Introduction to function development
* SessionFourteen: Reproducible Analysis in R (Rmarkdown, Bookdown and Shiny) 
* SessionFifteen: Package Development

<u>Level 3: Main goal is to introduce principle concepts and methods of Statistics</u>

Here is what We will learn:

* SessionSixteen: Introduction to Descriptive Statistics
* SessionSeventeen: Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
* SessionEighteen: Introduction to Inferential Statistics
* SessionNineteen: Introduction to Categorical Analysis
* SessionTwenty: Introduction to Time Series Analysis
* SessionTwentyOne: Introduction to Survival Analysis

<h4> Approach used</h4>

Level one is geared towards introducing R and preparing for the real application. This is a requirement for the rest of the tutorial as the core foundation of R is introduced. In this level, you get to appreciate that data need not be survey data that is usually collected for inference. It can be data that can be easily sourced from everyday activity. For example income generated from services rendered or data from training exercise monitors. The idea is that analytical literacy is essential in turning readily available data into useful knowledge.

Level two is meant to impart some programming skills for those interested in going beyond simple analysis. The skills learnt in this level will aid in developing user defined functions. If your goal is to learn how to use R to do basic analysis, then you can skip the second level and only refer to it as need be.

Actual application or analysis begins at level three. In this level, you get to learn data analysis from descriptive to inferential statistics using survey data. At this point the assumption is that you know how to use one of the statistical programs and more so R. So the discussion will be on the analysis rather than the codes used to do the analysis.   

<h4> Becoming an R'st</h4>

The biggest question anyone will eventually ask you as you work with R is, 'Why R?'. Indeed, R is one of the many analytical tools, and the key word here is "a tool". So why select it as your analytical tool and not another? I will leave you to answer that question after you have worked with R for some time.

But what I can tell you, R grows on you. At first it might seem a bit different and if you are not well grounded, you might find it difficult in the beginning. As time goes by and you interact with R, learning and using its vast capabilities, you start getting used to it. I personally think its growing usage and most importantly the increasing innovations and packages (add-on), is a big indicator as to where R is headed. For example, the notes as well as the power point presentations are all done using R; there is no need to open text documents and copying your code in it. There are also web apps (applications) like Shinny that you can use to build online analytical applications. But what R is best known for, is its graphing capabilities and a lot of analysts use R for their graphs. Well, I could go on, but it would be good for you to experience R and make your recommendations.

As a new user of R, my strongest advice (based on experience), is to get the basics right. The issues we shall soon be discussing like data types, objects, workingspace, getting help, etcetera, are key to becoming a good R user or programmer. In addition to this tutorial, I recommend you join some of the well known online courses like DataCamp, swirl as well as Coursera's data science specialization. YouTube also has very good lecture series on R and lastly but definitely not the least, I recommend the good old fashioned way of learn anything - reading an R textbook. In addition, try and do as many exercises as you can from these resources, or go to the help pages like the R mailing group and try to figure out solutions for areas you have covered then assess your progress with solutions offered. This will gain you a substantial mileage as far as R programming is concerned.

Of course I cannot fail to mention that R is completely free, and maintained by passionate people. It has its shortcomings, but in every one of them, there is someone somewhere driven by sheer desire to solve the problem, so you would find that the solution to any of the shortcomings has been addressed or is on the pipeline to being solved.

It is therefore my hope that these tutorials will create more r users or what I fondly call R'sts. I believe anyone can learn to code if they are given a good foundation and no assumptions are made. So code away and become a budding analyst or R'st.

<h4>Fee</h4>

This is a free online course. But feel free to support this noble venture.
