# My-tutorial-Documents

A repository for three tutorial books, "R Essentials", "R - Beyond Essentials" and "Introduction to Data Analysis and Graphics using R".

R Essentials is intended for new beginners in a Statistical software called R. Each chapter is written to impart a specific concept building up to a level where one is able to work with R effectively.

R- Beyond Essentials is intended for intermediate level R users interested in perfecting their skills. Core of this book is programming and specifically developing functions and programs. Ultimately, a reader should be able to become an R programmer as well as a package and Shiny developer.

Essentials of Data Analysis and Graphics using R is meant to be the highlight of this tutorial series. It will impart data analysis skills for which any statistical program can be used, however, examples will be based on R hence the need to have a basic knowledge of the program.

Currently, first version of "R Essentials" is released and work has began on the other two books. E-book can be accessed from this [repository's web page](http://helleng.github.io/Data_Mgt_Analysis_and_Graphics_R/) (hosted by GitHub pages).
