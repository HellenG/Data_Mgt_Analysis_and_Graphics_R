# My-tutorial-Documents

A repository for my tutorial documents (Blog posts, Notes, Slides, R Scripts, Figures and Images)

This is still work in progress, but just uploaded first draft of Session One (Level One), check it out.

Still woking on the demo's and I will upload them as soon as possible, but the notes are sufficient to move to session two.

Good reading.
